\f0\fs24 \cf0 THE DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL : THE DEFINITIVE EDITION \
\
\
Anne Frank \
\
Edited by Otto H. Frank and Mirjam Pressler \
Translated by Susan Massotty \
\
\
BOOK FLAP \
\
Anne Frank's The Diary of a Young Girl is among the most enduring documents of the \
twentieth century. Since its publication in 1947, it has been read by tens of millions \
of people all over the world. It remains a beloved and deeply admired testament to the \
indestructable nature of the human spirit. \
\
Restore in this Definitive Edition are diary entries that had been omitted from the \
original edition. These passages, which constitute 30 percent more material, reinforce \
the fact that Anne was first and foremost a teenage girl, not a remote and flawless \
symbol. She fretted about, and tried to copie with, her own emerging sexuality. Like \
many young girls, she often found herself in disagreement with her mother. And like \
any teenager, she veered between the carefree nature of a child and the full-fledged \
sorrow of an adult. Anne emerges more human, more vulnerable, and more vital than \
ever. \
\
Anne Frank and her family, fleeing the horrors of Nazi occupation, hid in the back of \
an Amsterdam warehouse for two years. She was thirteen when the family went into \
the Secret Annex, and in these pages she grows to be a young woman and a wise \
observer of human nature as well. With unusual insight, she reveals the relations \
between eight people living under extraordinary conditions, facing hunger, the \
ever-present threat of discovery and death, complete estrangement from the outside \
world, and above all, the boredom, the petty misunderstandings, and the frustrations of \
living under such unbearable strain, in such confined quarters. \
\
A timely story rediscovered by each new generation, The Diary of a Young Girl stands \
without peer. For both young readers and adults it continues to bring to life this \
young woman, who for a time survived the worst horror of the modern world had seen \
\'97 and who remained triumphantly and heartbreakingly human throughout her ordeal. \
For those who know and love Anne Frank, The Definitive Edition is a chance to \
discover her anew. For readers who have not yet encountered her, this is the edition \
to cherish. \
\
\
\
ANNE FRANK was born on June 12, 1929. She died while imprisoned at \
Bergen\'97 Belsen, three months short of her sixteenth birthday. OTTO H. FRANK was \
the only member of his immediate framily to survive the Holocaust. He died in 1980. \
MIRJAM PRESSFER is a popular writer of books for young adults. She lives in \
Germany. \

\
FOREWORD \
\
Anne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. Initially, she wrote \
it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the \
Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast from Fondon that after the \
war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people \
under the German occupation, which could be made available to the public. As an \
example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries. \
\
Impressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the war was over she would \
publish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and editing her diary, \
improving on the text, omitting passages she didn't think were interesting enough and \
adding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her original diary. In the \
scholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne's first, \
unedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited \
diary, which is known as version b. \
\
The last entry in Anne's diary is dated August 1, 1944. On August 4, 1944, the eight \
people hiding in the Secret Annex were arrested. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, the two \
secretaries working in the building, found Anne's diaries strewn allover the floor. ,Miep \
Gies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it \
became clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread, to Anne's father, Otto \
Frank. \
\
After long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his daughter's wish and publish \
her diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editing them into a shorter \
version later referred to as version c. Readers all over the world know this as The \
Diary of a fauna Girl. \
\
\
In making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, \
\
\
\
the book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a series put out by the \
Dutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing with Anne's sexuality were \
omitted; at the time of the diary's initial publication, in 1947, it was not customary to \
write openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young adults. Out of respect for \
the dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering passages about his wife and \
the other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was thirteen when she \
began her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about \
her likes and dislikes. \
\
When Otto Frank died in 1980, he willed his daughter's manuscripts to the Netherlands \
State Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam. Because the authenticity of the \
diary had been challenged ever since its publication, the Institute for War \
Documentation ordered a thorough investigation. Once the diary was proved, beyond a \
shadow of a doubt, to be genuine, it was published in its entirety, along with the \
results of an exhaustive study. The Critical Edition contains not only versions a, band \
c, but also articles on the background of the Frank family, the circumstances \
surrounding their arrest and deportation, and the examination into Anne's handwriting, \
the document and the materials used. \
\
The Anne Frank\'97 Fonds (Anne Frank Foundation) in Basel (Switzerland),, which as \
Otto Frank's sole heir had also inherited his daughter's copyrights, then decided to \
have anew, expanded edition of the diary published for general readers. This new \
edition in no way affects the integrity of the old one originally edited by Otto Frank, \
which brought the diary and its message to millions of people. The task of compthng \
the expanded edition was given to the writer and translator Mirjam Pressler. Otto \
Frank's original selection has now been supplemented with passages from Anne's a and \
b versions. Mirjam Pressler's definitive edition, approved by the Anne Frank\'97 Fonds, \
contains approximately 30 percent more material and is intended to give the reader \
more insight into the world of Anne Frank. \
\
In writing her second version (b), Anne invented pseudonyms for the people who \
would appear in her book. She initially wanted to call herself Anne Aulis, and later \
Anne Robin. Otto Frank opted to call his family by their own names and to follow \
Anne's wishes with regard to the others. Over the years, the identity of the people \
who helped the family in the Secret Annex has become common knowledge. In this \
edition, the helpers are now referred to by their real names, as they so justly deserve \
to be. All other persons are named in accordance with the pseudonyms in The Critical \
Edition. The Institute for War Documentation has arbitrarily assigned initials to those \
persons wishing to remain anonymous. \
\
\
The real names of the other people hiding in the Secret Annex are: \
\
\
\
THE VAN PELS FAMILY \
(from Osnabriick, Germany): \
\
Auguste van Pels (born September 9, 1890) \
\
Hermann van Pels (born March 31, 1889) \
\
Peter van Pels (born November 8, 1926) \
\
Called by Anne, in her manuscript: Petronella, Hans and Alfred van Daan; and in the \
book: Petronella, Hermann and Peter van Daan. \
\
FRITZ PFEFFER \
\
(born April 30, 1889, in Giessen, Germany): \
\
Called by Anne, in her manuscript and in the book: Alfred Dussel. \
\
The reader may wish to bear in mind that much of this edition is based on the b \
version of Anne's diary, which she wrote when she was around fifteen years old. \
Occasionally, Anne went back and commented on a passage she had written earlier. \
These comments are clearly marked in this edition. Naturally, Anne's spelling and \
linguistic errors have been corrected. Otherwise, the text has basically been left as \
she wrote it, since any attempts at editing and clarification would be inappropriate in a \
historical document. \
\
\
I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to \
confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. \

\
I hope I will be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to \
confide in anyone, and I hope you will be a great source of comfort and support. \
\
COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE ON SEPTEMBER 28, 1942: So far you truly have been \
a areat source of comfort to me, and so has Kitty, whom I now write to regularly. \
This way of keeping a diary is much nicer, and now I can hardly wait for those \
moments when I'm able to write in you. Oh, I'm so alad I brought you along! \
\
\
\
SUNDAY, JUNE 14, 1942 \
\
\
I'll begin from the moment I got you, the moment I saw you lying on the table among \
\
my other birthday presents. (I went along when you were bought, but that doesn't \
\
count.) \
\
On Friday, June 12, I was awake at six o'clock, which isn't surprising, since it was \
my birthday. But I'm not allowed to get up at that hour, so I had to control my \
curiosity until quarter to seven. When I couldn't wait any longer, I went to the dining \
room, where Moortje (the cat) welcomed me by rubbing against my legs. \
\
A little after seven I went to Daddy and Mama and then to the living room to open \
\
my presents, and you were the first thing I saw, maybe one of my nicest presents. \
\
Then a bouquet of roses, some peonies and a potted plant. From Daddy and Mama I \
got a blue blouse, a game, a bottle of grape juice, which to my mind tastes a bit like \
wine (after all, wine is made from grapes), a puzzle, a jar of cold cream, 2.50 guilders \
and a gift certificate for two books. I got another book as well, Camera Obscura (but \
Margot already has it, so I exchanged mine for something else), a platter of \
homemade cookies (which I made myself, of course, since I've become quite an expert \
at baking cookies), lots of candy and a strawberry tart from Mother. And a letter from \
Grammy, right on time, but of course that was just a coincidence. \
\
Then Hanneli came to pick me up, and we went to school. During recess I passed out \
cookies to my teachers and my class, and then it was time to get back to work. I \
didn't arrive home until five, since I went to gym with the rest of the class. (I'm not \
allowed to take part because my shoulders and hips tend to get dislocated.) As it was \
my birthday, I got to decide which game my classmates would play, and I chose \
volleyball. Afterward they all danced around me in a circle and sang "Happy Birthday." \
When I got home, Sanne Federmann was already there. Ilse Wagner, Hanneli Goslar \
and Jacqueline van Maarsen came home with me after gym, since we're in the same \
class. Hanneli and Sanne used to be my two best friends. People who saw us together \
used to say, "There goes Anne, Hanne and Sanne." I only met Jacqueline van Maarsen \
when I started at the Jewish Fyceum, and now she's my best friend. Ilse is Hanneli's \
best friend, and Sanne goes to another school and has friends there. \
\
They gave me a beautiful book, Dutch Sasas and Lesends, but they gave me Volume II \
by mistake, so I exchanged two other books for Volume I. Aunt Helene brought me a \
puzzle, Aunt Stephanie a darling brooch and Aunt Deny a terrific book: Daisy Goes to \
the Mountains. \
\
\
This morning I lay in the bathtub thinking how wonderful it would be if I had a dog \
\
\
\
like Rin Tin Tin. I'd call him Rin Tin Tin too, and I'd take him to school with me, \
where he could stay in the janitor's room or by the bicycle racks when the weather \
was good. \
\
\
MONDAY, JUNE 15, 1942 \
\
I had my birthday party on Sunday afternoon. The Rin Tin Tin movie was a big hit \
with my classmates. I got two brooches, a bookmark and two books. I'll start by \
saying a few things about my school and my class, beginning with the students. \
\
Betty Bloemendaal looks kind of poor, and I think she probably is. She lives on some \
obscure street in West Amsterdam, and none of us know where it is. She does very \
well at school, but that's because she works so hard, not because she's so smart. \
She's pretty quiet. \
\
Jacqueline van Maarsen is supposedly my best friend, but I've never had a real friend. \
At first I thought Jacque would be one, but I was badly mistaken. \
\
D. Q.* [* Initials have been assigned at random to those persons who prefer to remain \
anonymous.] is a very nervous girl who's always forgetting things, so the teachers \
keep assigning her extra homework as punishment. She's very kind, especially to G.Z. \
\
E. S. talks so much it isn't funny. She's always touching your hair or fiddling with your \
buttons when she asks you something. They say she can't stand me, but I don't care, \
since I don't like her much either. \
\
Henny Mets is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, except that she talks in a loud \
voice and is really childish when we're playing outdoors. Unfortunately, Henny has a \
girlfriend named Beppy who's a bad influence on her because she's dirty and vulgar. \
\
J.R. - I could write a whole book about her. J. is a detestable, sneaky, stuck-up, \
two-faced gossip who thinks she's so grown-up. She's really got Jacque under her \
spell, and that's a shame. J. is easily offended, bursts into tears at the slightest thing \
and, to top it all off, is a terrible show-off. Miss J. always has to be right. She's \
very rich, and has a closet full of the most adorable dresses that are way too old for \
her. She thinks she's gorgeous, but she's not. J. and I can't stand each other. \
\
Use Wagner is a nice girl with a cheerful disposition, but she's extremely finicky and \
can spend hours moaning and groaning about something. Ilse likes me a lot. She's very \
smart, but lazy. \
\
\
\
Hanneli Goslar, or Lies as she's called at school, is a bit on the strange side. She's \
usually shy \'97 outspoken at home, but reserved around other people. She blabs \
whatever you tell her to her mother. But she says what she thinks, and lately I've \
corne to appreciate her a great deal. \
\
Nannie van Praag-Sigaar is small, funny and sensible. I think she's nice. She's pretty \
smart. There isn't much else you can say about Nannie. Eefje de Jong is, in my \
opinion, terrific. Though she's only twelve, she's quite the lady. She acts as if I were \
a baby. She's also very helpful, and I like her. \
\
G.Z. is the prettiest girl in our class. She has a nice face, but is kind of dumb. I think \
\
they're going to hold her back a year, but of course I haven't told her that. \
\
COMMENT ADDED BY ANNE AT A LATER DATE: To my areat surprise, G.Z. \
wasn't held back a year after all. \
\
And sitting next to G.Z. is the last of us twelve girls, me. \
\
There's a lot to be said about the boys, or maybe not so much after all. \
\
Maurice Coster is one of my many admirers, but pretty much of a pest. Sallie \
Springer has a filthy mind, and rumor has it that he's gone all the way. Still, I think \
he's terrific, because he's very funny. \
\
Emiel Bonewit is G.Z.'s admirer, but she doesn't care. He's pretty boring. Rob Cohen \
used to be in love with me too, but I can't stand him anymore. He's an obnoxious, \
\
two-faced, lying, sniveling little goof who has an awfully high opinion of himself. \
\
Max van de Velde is a farm boy from Medemblik, but eminently suitable, as Margot \
would say. \
\
Herman Koopman also has a filthy mind, just like Jopie de Beer, who's a terrible flirt \
and absolutely girl-crazy. \
\
Leo Blom is Jopie de Beer's best friend, but has been ruined by his dirty mind. \
\
Albert de Mesquita came from the Montessori School and skipped a grade. He's really \
smart. \
\
\
Leo Slager came from the same school, but isn't as smart. \
\
\
\
Ru Stoppelmon is a short, goofy boy from Almelo who transferred to this school in \
the middle of the year. \
\
\
C.N. does whatever he's not supposed to. \
\
Jacques Kocernoot sits behind us, next to C., and we (G. and I) laugh ourselves silly. \
Harry Schaap is the most decent boy in our class. He's nice. \
\
Werner Joseph is nice too, but all the changes taking place lately have made him too \
quiet, so he seems boring. Sam Salomon is one of those tough guys from across the \
tracks. A real brat. (Admirer!) \
\
Appie Riem is pretty Orthodox, but a brat too. \
\
SATURDAY, JUNE 20,1942 \
\
Writing in a diary is a really strange experience for someone like me. Not only \
because I've never written anything before, but also because it seems to me that later \
on neither I nor anyone else will be interested in the musings of a thirteen- year- old \
schoolgirl. Oh well, it doesn't matter. I feel like writing, and I have an even greater \
need to get all kinds of things off my chest. \
\
"Paper has more patience than people." I thought of this saying on one of those days \
when I was feeling a little depressed and was sitting at home with my chin in my \
hands, bored and listless, wondering whether to stay in or go out. I finally stayed \
where I was, brooding. Yes, paper does have more patience, and since I'm not planning \
to let anyone else read this stiff-backed notebook grandly referred to as a "diary," \
unless I should ever find a real friend, it probably won't make a bit of difference. \
\
Now I'm back to the point that prompted me to keep a diary in the first place: I don't \
have a friend. \
\
Let me put it more clearly, since no one will believe that a thirteen year-old girl is \
completely alone in the world. And I'm not. I have loving parents and a \
sixteen-year-old sister, and there are about thirty people I can call friends. I have a \
throng of admirers who can't keep their adoring eyes off me and who sometimes have \
to resort to using a broken pocket mirror to try and catch a glimpse of me in the \
classroom. I have a family, loving aunts and a good home. No, on the surface I seem \
to have everything, except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends \
is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary \
\
\
\
everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem. \
Maybe it's my fault that we don't confide in each other. In any case, that's just how \
\
things are, and unfortunately they're not liable to change. This is why I've started the \
\
diary. \
\
To enhance the image of this long-awaited friend in my imagination, I don't want to \
jot down the facts in this diary the way most people would do, but I want the diary \
to be my friend, and I'm going to call this friend Kitty. \
\
Since no one would understand a word of my stories to Kitty if I were to plunge right \
\
in, I'd better provide a brief sketch of my life, much as I dislike doing so. \
\
My father, the most adorable father I've ever seen, didn't marry my mother until he \
\
was thirty-six and she was twenty-five. My sister Margot was born in Frankfurt am \
\
Main in Germany in 1926. I was born on June 12, 1929. I lived in Frankfurt until I \
was four. Because we're Jewish, my father immigrated to Holland in 1933, when he \
became the Managing Director of the Dutch Opekta Company, which manufactures \
products used in making jam. My mother, Edith Hollander Frank, went with him to \
Holland in September, while Margot and I were sent to Aachen to stay with our \
grandmother. Margot went to Holland in December, and I followed in February, when I \
was plunked down on the table as a birthday present for Margot. \
\
I started right away at the Montessori nursery school. I stayed there until I was six, \
at which time I started first grade. In sixth grade my teacher was Mrs. Kuperus, the \
principal. At the end of the year we were both in tears as we said a heartbreaking \
\
farewell, because I'd been accepted at the Jewish Lyceum, where Margot also went to \
\
school. \
\
Our lives were not without anxiety, since our relatives in Germany were suffering \
under Hitler's anti-Jewish laws. After the pogroms in 1938 my two uncles (my \
mother's brothers) fled Germany, finding safe refuge in North America. My elderly \
grandmother came to live with us. She was seventy-three years old at the time. \
\
After May 1940 the good times were few and far between: first there was the war, \
then the capitulation and then the arrival of the Germans, which is when the trouble \
started for the Jews. Our freedom was severely restricted by a series of anti-Jewish \
decrees: Jews were required to wear a yellow star: Jews were required to turn in \
their bicycles! Jews were forbidden to use street-cars! Jews were forbidden to ride in \
cars, even their own! Jews were required to do their shopping between 3 and 5 P.M.! \
Jews were required to frequent only Jewish-owned barbershops and beauty parlors! \
Jews were forbidden to be out on the streets between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.! Jews were \
\
\
\
forbidden to attend theaters, movies or any other forms of entertainment; Jews were \
forbidden to use swimming pools, tennis courts, hockey fields or any other athletic \
fields; Jews were forbidden to go rowing; Jews were forbidden to take part in any \
athletic activity in public; Jews were forbidden to sit in their gardens or those of their \
friends after 8 P.M.; Jews were forbidden to visit Christians in their homes; Jews \
were required to attend Jewish schools, etc. You couldn't do this and you couldn't do \
that, but life went on. Jacque always said to me, "I don't dare do anything anymore, \
'cause I'm afraid it's not allowed." \
\
In the summer of 1941 Grandma got sick and had to have an operation, so my \
birthday passed with little celebration. In the summer of 1940 we didn't do much for \
my birthday either, since the fighting had just ended in Holland. Grandma died in \
January 1942. No one knows how often I think of her and still love her. This birthday \
celebration in 1942 was intended to make up for the others, and Grandma's candle was \
lit along with the rest. \
\
The four of us are still doing well, and that brings me to the present date of June 20, \
1942, and the solemn dedication of my diary. \
